    You will be prompted to decide the mode: encrypt or decrypt.
    Type e and hit enter to encrypt.  Type d and hit enter to decrypt.
    These are the only accepted inputs

    Next you will be prompted for the text to encrypt or decrypt.
    Text is case insensitive, but must not include any whitespace, and length must not exceed 512 characters.
    To sumbit this text, hit enter.

    Next you will be prompted for the encryption or decryption key.
    The key is case insensitive, but must not include any whitespace. 
    If the key is less than 25 characters long, the missing characters are added to the end alphabetically.
    If the key is more than 25 characters long, the program will fail.
    There must not be any duplicate characters in the key.  
    Also do not put both 'i' and 'j' in the key, as these are interpreted as the same character.
    To submit the key, hit enter.

    Finally you will be prompted for the integer period.
    This must be an integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
    Type the desired integer period and hit enter.
